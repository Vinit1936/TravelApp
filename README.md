Brief Description of the app:- 
This travel app is designed to help users plan their trips effortlessly by offering features like destination search, transport and hotel booking, and personalised itinerary creation. With the help of a smart chatbot, users can generate travel plans based on their budget and preferences. The app focuses on providing a smooth, user-friendly experience, allowing users to explore, plan, book, and share their trips â€” all in one place. During the UI/UX design process of the travel app, we focused on creating a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experience. Key changes included simplifying the navigation to reduce steps, integrating a smart chatbot to assist users in generating travel plans based on their budget, and introducing personalised filters for easier booking. We redesigned the visual hierarchy with consistent icons, spacing, and a minimalist colour scheme to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load. A dedicated itinerary screen was added for better trip overview and sharing, and all designs were made fully responsive to ensure smooth use across devices. These changes aimed to make trip planning faster, clearer, and more enjoyable for users.
